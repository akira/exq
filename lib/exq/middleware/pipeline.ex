defmodule Exq.Middleware.Pipeline do
  @moduledoc """
  Pipeline is a structure that is used as an argument in functions of module with
  `Exq.Middleware.Behaviour` behaviour. This structure must be returned by particular function
  to be used in the next middleware based on defined middleware chain.

  Pipeline contains the following options:

  * `assigns` - map that contains shared data across the whole job lifecycle
  * `worker_pid` - process id of `Exq.Worker.Server`
  * `event` - name of current middleware function, possible values are: `before_work`,
  `after_processed_work` and `after_failed_work`
  * `halted` - flag indicating whether pipeline was halted, defaults to `false`
  * `terminated` - flag indicating whether worker and pipeline were halted, If
      the flag was set to true, the job will not be dispatched and all after_*_work/1
      will be skipped. For each specific middleware:
      - Exq.Middleware.Job: Will NOT remove the backup from job queue
      - Exq.Middleware.Logger: Will NOT record job as done or failed with timestamp
      - Exq.Middleware.Manager: Will NOT update worker counter
      - Exq.Middleware.Stats: Will NOT remove job from processes queue
